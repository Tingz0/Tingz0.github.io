Hi, thanks for visiting my website! My name is Agnieszka. (Either /aɡˈɲɛʂ.ka/ or Aga works. Coincidence with [AGA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AGA_cooker) and [Agha](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agha_(title)) is accidental.) 

I am a second-year PhD student within the [Artificial Intelligence Group](https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/research/ai/) at the University of Cambridge. In 2020, I interned at [Facebook AI Research](https://ai.facebook.com/) where I was hosted by [Léon Bottou](https://leon.bottou.org/).

My PhD supervisors are [Sean Holden](https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~sbh11/) and [Mateja Jamnik](https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~mj201/). I spent 10 months of my PhD as a Research Intern at [Mila](https://mila.quebec/en/) where I collaborated with [William L. Hamilton](https://www.cs.mcgill.ca/~wlh/), [Anirudh Goyal](https://anirudh9119.github.io) and [Yoshua Bengio](https://yoshuabengio.org). 

<span style="color:green;font-size:20px"> **My PhD topic: Understanding and improving out-of-distribution generalisation in machine learning. I investigate this topic in the linear data regime, visual reasoning, multi-agent communication and medical data.**</span> <a href="https://twitter.com/slowiika?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" class="twitter-follow-button" data-show-screen-name="false" data-show-count="false">Follow @slowiika</a><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

Apart from research, I teach maths, programming and applied machine learning at [Cambridge Spark](https://cambridgespark.com/). I also do my best to contribute to the departmental activities as well as to the broad machine learning research community (most recently, as a reviewer for [AISTATS 2021](http://aistats.org/aistats2021/), [ICLR 2021](https://iclr.cc/Conferences/2021/Dates), [ICML 2020](https://icml.cc), [EMNLP 2020](https://2020.emnlp.org/) and [NeurIPS 2020](https://nips.cc/Conferences/2020/)). 

I hold an MSc with Distinction in Operational Research with Data Science from the University of Edinburgh (a joint programme between the School of Mathematics and the School of Informatics). In my [MSc thesis](https://www.dropbox.com/s/gvxaaxrqvkjr2np/thesis.pdf?dl=0) I proposed a new approach to relational reasoning with convolutional neural networks. I also hold a BSc degree in Computer Science from the Jagiellonian University. In my BSc thesis I investigated probability distributions defining random projections in extreme learning machines under supervision of [Wojciech Czarnecki](http://wojciechczarnecki.com).

Before my PhD, I had an opportunity to intern in data science and software engineering at IBM, Architech and Barclays UK.

I'm a traveller at heart: I visited 35 countries and lived in five so far. On that note, I had a chance to learn four foreign languages, which allows me to throw awkward sentences in attempts at icebreaking to this day. I also love mountains, reading and [Andrej Ivašković](https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~ai294/).
