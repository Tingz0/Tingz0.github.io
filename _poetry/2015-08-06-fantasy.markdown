## Gaussian Mixture models
if we.....
Here we take Gaussian mixture models as an example to illustrate and compare different sampler.

## Content

The content of this article is as followed:
1. Rejection sampling
2. Importance sampling
3. Gibbs sampling
4. Metropolis Hasting sampling
5. Data Augmentation
6. Reversible Jump Algorithm
7. Simulated Annealing


We will use trend plot, ergodic mean, Rieman sum and Kolmogorov-Smirnov test as methods to assess the convergence of our samplers.
